# CREATING A BUSINESS ACCOUNT
   - Sign up form should send data containing both user information and the organization account information to the api
   - Data should be validated for email uniqueness and data validation and sanitization
   - data should save correctly including the codeNumber(for the user collection only) generated to be sent to the users email for verification to both the user collection and organization account collection and also the isverified should be false which is set by default
   - in the process of saving the user information and organization information, the user ID (creator) should be set as the admin in the userCollection
   - after the data is saved, a mail should be sent to the users email where email includes the code number set to await verification in another endpoint
   - in the verification endpoint; codeNumber should be compared to the one saved in the users document, if true then update isVerified to true
   - an endpoint should also be placed to reset password for the user incase he as forgotten password, this endpoint should send a resetCodeNumber to the mail for verification and saved to the database for verification
# JOINING A BUSINESS CHANNEL
   - email sent should be validated if it exist in the invites array of the organization document
   -  if invite is true then check the email as a document registered
      - if email doesn't exist or belong to any user document, then send a response to indicate to the client app that is a new user and should be registered
      - if email does exist but belongs to an unverified user who hasnt verified that mail, then a response should be sent back to indicate the user is not new but email or account as not been verified
